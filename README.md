## Concept
Inevitably, in any scenario, robots, or artificial intelligence, have gradually become integrated into human society. Robotics experts consider some attributes, such as robot gender. Robots have no gender - they are metal, plastic and silicon, and are full of "1s" and "0s". But humans have always been able to make their judgements by cues such as appearance, colour, personality and voice. The problem for robot designers today is to create fairer gender norms that challenge current gender stereotypes. Better gender norms in robot society will also feed back into human society.
The scales of robotic gender do not exist, But it has done its best to maintain its balance. Good human gender norms will help this 'balance' to be better maintained, and a blanket disregard and misuse of stereotypes will reflect badly on it.

## How It Works        
The project "X" aims to visualise the gender dilemma faced by robots, with a beam, a ball and a machine-generated digital jellyfish as the centre of vision.
1. When the user approaches the installation, LEDs will light up.           
2. A video on screen plays a photo of the generated electronic jellyfish and subtitles guide the user in guessing their gender. The leftmost side is male, the rightmost is female and the position of the ball will be taken as the user's answer. The user can move the pieces to influence the servo‚Äôs angle at so that the ball stay at their ideal position. Of course the result may be unsatisfactory.               
3. When the angle of the beam reaches a certain value, the video will be distorted and glitched.
